        <h1>It's a world of words</h1><p class="quote">"Sticks and stones may break our bones but words can break our spirit."</p><p class="right">- James Howe, <i>The Misfits</i></p>
    <p>Words hurt. So think before you talk. Words are powerful, so use them wisely. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.</p>

        <h1>It's a world of actions</h1><p class="quote">"...we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act but a habit."</p><p class="right">- Will Durant</p>
    <p>Thoughts lead too words. Words lead to actions. So think before you do something. Do what your inner self wants to do, not your friends.</p>

        <h1>It's a world of ideas</h1><p class="quote">"Be Yourself. Everyone Else Is Already Taken"</p><p class="right">- Oscar Wilde</p>
    <p>Do your ideas. Follow, and pass your dreams. Accept other's dreams. Let you be you. Let everyone else be everyone else. Let yourself do your ideas. Let everyone else do their ideas.</p>

        <h1>It's a world of feelings</h1><p class="quote">"Like a snake sheds it's skin, we must shed our past over and over again."</p><p class="right">- Buddha</p>
    <p>Live in the moment, might miss something. Breathe, or you will suffocate. If you don't feel good, it's a bad day for you. If someone else isn't feeling good, it's a bad day for them. Everyone has them. But every bad day has good parts. So be in the moment. Or you'll miss them...</p>

    <p>Be nice to others, so they will be nice to you. Accept others, so they will accept you. Help others, so they will help you. But don't try to be like others: be you!</p>
