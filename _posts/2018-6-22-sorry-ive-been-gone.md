I just realized I haven't posted since April! Today was my last day of school for the year. I was busy with some things, but now I'll be able to post more. About poll of the month, I'm not doing that anymore. I started this in June 2017, about a year ago, and it has changed. On my old site, I had a "Contests" section where I would ask a weird question and visitors would try to answer it. I removed it because:

> Bye Bye Contests

> 6/19/2016

> Sadly, we had to remove the contest section. Here's why:
> - To much work to update every week
> - Problems with names such as "Sparkly Unicorn " or "Stinkers rule"

> We may bring it back sometime this summer when I have more time

Poll of the month was later added on 6/11/2017, joined by quiz of the month on 6/14/2017, which ended on 9/2/2017. I'm getting rid of poll of the month for now, because nobody would respond to the poll. If five people comment "I want poll of the month back", I will bring it back.
