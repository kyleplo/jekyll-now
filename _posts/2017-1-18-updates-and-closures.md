If you were on my website yesterday, that is impossible. Because my site was down yesterday. Sorry. I was experimenting with some domain stuff that clearly did not go as planned. If you read [this post](/b/compare-server-langs), you know I have my 1and1 subscription back! So the next few days, I will be changing some stuff on this website.
