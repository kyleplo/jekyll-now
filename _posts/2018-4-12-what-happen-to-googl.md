This is now what you see when you visit http://goo.gl . What happened? It turns out Google no longer wants people to use their URL shortener, goo.gl. Somehow, this is a way to promote [Firebase Dynamic Links](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/). How does that work? They are telling new customers to go to bit.ly or ow.ly. If you need a new shortener, I reccomend reading [this post](/b/cool-url-shorteners), but my personal favorite is http://is.gd .

By the way, Firebase Dynamic Links look a bit cool if you plan on building a mobile app.
