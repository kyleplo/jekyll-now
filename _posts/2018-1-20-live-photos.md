Yesterday, I got an iPad Pro, and it is great. But one feature I still don't quite understand is: Live photos. How can a photo be live? Wouldn't a live photo be a video? Or is it more like a GIF?

Here is what I think it is: A live photo is sort of like a GIF. When you take a live photo, it keeps taking pictures for a second or two. These are then combined to make a GIF. You can choose the best frame, layer all frames on top of each other, or choose to animate it. There are two ways to animate it:
#### Loop

With this option, the frames are displayed in order and then they jump back to the start.
#### Bounce

With this option, the frames are displayed in order and then they display in reverse.
