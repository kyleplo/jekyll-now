From [an idea I found online](#the-idea), I made a shirt with CSS code for a ghost. This is my Halloween costume. The code on the shirt, if you can't read it is:
```css
.ghost {
  opacity: 0.5;
  background: white;
/* Noo! Ghost attack! */
  visibility: hidden;
  display: none;
    }
```
### The idea

### My version

Sorry about the image quality. You can make your own with a shirt, fabric paint and some CSS knowledge!
