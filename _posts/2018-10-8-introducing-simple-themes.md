title: Introducing Simple Themes!
categories: blog themes jekyll
---
If you've been around my profile lately, you might have seen I created a new Github orginization, @simple-themes. I'm planning to make lots of themes for Jekyll, and soon I plan on changing this website to use one of the themes. Here are some of the currents themes:

- blank (finished) [Try it!](https://simple-themes.github.io/blank-theme)
- splash (finished) [Try it!](https://simple-themes.github.io/splash-theme)
- intro (in development)
- checkers (not started)
- galaxy (not started)
- And many more, that don't have names yet...

I also might make a visual Jekyll site builder if I feel like it.

All of these themes will use Github's special `remote-theme` key for the `_config.yml` file, so by plunking that into your config and adding a few more files, your site will be up and running in no time.

Design for planned themes:


| Theme Name | Description                                                    | Features                                                 | Design                                                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| blank      | A basic theme for both professional and personal websites      | tags, comments, pages, search                            | navbar, no header                                                     |
| splash     | A good theme for small sites, looks good even without posts    | image bg, search, pages                                  | image background with basic text, modal search                        |
| intro      | A theme that introduces you or your product as you scroll down | tags, comments, pages, image bg, search, featured images | header with image, navbar, flexbox-type sections                      |
| checkers   | A sidebar-type theme with black and white                      | tags, comments, search, archives                         | sidebar, b&w, complex archive system                                  |
| galaxy     | A super-scroll theme with everything on one page               | image bg, pages, search                                  | similar to splash theme, but has fixed background and content scrolls |
