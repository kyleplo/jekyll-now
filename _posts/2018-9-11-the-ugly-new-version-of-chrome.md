Recently, I came across photos of Chrome 69. I thought, "Is that a Photoshop? That toolbar looks just like Microsoft Edge!" But nope, it's Chrome alright.

Now that you've seen it, do you agree? I'm going to change my default browser to Firefox and say bye to Chrome for now. Google, please change it back, because you're losing customers, like me.
