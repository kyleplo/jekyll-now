One bad thing about Github Pages is that it is hard to create forms on it. So I decided to create a Weebly site to host all of my forms, because forms are so easy there. The site is [here](http://kyleplosforms.weebly.com/). You can also request to have a form create for you. Because of this, I will resume poll of the month!
