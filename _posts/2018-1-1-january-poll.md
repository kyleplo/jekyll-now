Hello, happy new year!!

As you may have read in a [previous post](https://kyleplo.github.io/b/jekyll-comments/), I now have comments on my site! So for this month's poll, you can enter your poll response in the comments below. If you don't have a Github account, you can fill it out [here](http://kyleplosforms.weebly.com/forms/january-poll) instead, but I may not provide this option in the future...

**The question this month is:**
How many of the things you like are you good at?

Also, if you are December poll results, santa's adventure won, but only one person voted...
