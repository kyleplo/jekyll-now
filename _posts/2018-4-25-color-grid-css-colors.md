When I first learn SVG, it took me a while to figure out how to use any colors other than the default CSS colors (`red`,`blue`,`alicewhite`, etc.) Now, of course I know you can use other colors, but I wanted to see if I could build an 8x6 color grid using only CSS colors. Here is how it would look:

8 different shades of grey - black on left - white on right
   - 
8 really light colors - red, orange, yellow, green, 2 blues, purple, pink
   -
8 light colors
   -
8 medium brightness colors
   -
8 dark colors
   -
8 really dark colors
   -

# The result
It took some time, but I got it done. [See it here!](../c/demos/css-color-grid)

It was tricky. The hardest colors to decide were probably light blue, purple and pink. The ones that came at the best were probably yellow and dark blue. Feel free to use this layout of colors if you give credit.
