<p>I've hidden some April Fool's pranks around this site, and it's up to you to find them!</p>
<p>More will be added as it gets closing to <s onclick="bop()">Easter</s> April Fools Day.</p>
<p>It might help to check <a href="#" onclick="bop()">Github</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/213404365/" onmouseover="bop()">this scratch project</a>.</p>
<p>When you <span onclick="bop()">find a prank</span>, you will hear a noise and see an easter egg.</p>
