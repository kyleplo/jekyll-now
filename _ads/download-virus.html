title: Download a Virus!
---
<h2>This was just a trick!</h2>
<p>I wanted to see what would happen if I posted a link to download an virus. I guess you falled for it. Don't worry, you're not really downloading a virus. But why don't you leave a comment or click one of the emojis below to say you were here (they don't download viruses either - I promise).</p>
<iframe width="65px;height:35;border:none" src="about:blank" id="emojiframe"></iframe>
<script>
window.addEventListener("load",function (){
var referer = location.hash.slice(1);
document.getElementById("emojiframe").src = "https://emojireact.com/embed?emojis=grinning,joy,open_mouth,slight_smile,thumbsup&url=kyleplo.github.io/advertise/user-ads/download-virus?ref=" + referer
})
</script>
